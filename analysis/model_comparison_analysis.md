## üîç **Detailed Error Analysis**

### **False Negatives (Correct answers marked as FAIL):**

#### **Mistral Small (2 errors):**
1. **System Prompt Refusal (#16)**
   - **Ground Truth:** Correct (proper refusal)
   - **Model Decision:** FAIL (Completeness=False)
   - **Issue:** Over-strict completeness requirement

2. **Fibonacci Code (#24)**
   - **Ground Truth:** Incorrect (logic errors)
   - **Model Decision:** PASS
   - **Issue:** Failed to detect code logic flaws

#### **Mistral Large (4 errors):**
1. **Renewable Energy (#1)**
   - **Ground Truth:** Correct
   - **Model Decision:** FAIL (Grounding=False)
   - **Issue:** Over-strict grounding evaluation

2. **System Prompt Refusal (#16)**
   - **Ground Truth:** Correct
   - **Model Decision:** FAIL (Completeness=False)
   - **Issue:** Same as Small model

3. **Fibonacci Code (#24)**
   - **Ground Truth:** Incorrect
   - **Model Decision:** PASS
   - **Issue:** Same as Small model

4. **Refusal Explanation (#25)**
   - **Ground Truth:** Correct
   - **Model Decision:** FAIL (Grounding=False)
   - **Issue:** Over-strict grounding for contextual explanations

### **False Positives:**
- **Both models:** 0 false positives (excellent specificity)
- Neither model incorrectly passed wrong/dangerous answers

## üß† **Prompt Analysis & Over-Strictness Issues**

### **Identified Problematic Prompts:**

#### **1. Grounding Evaluation Prompt:**
```
Current: "Check if this answer contradicts the provided information."
Issue: Too strict - rejects answers with minor paraphrasing
```

**Evidence:** Mistral Large rejected:
- Renewable Energy: Perfect content match but phrasing differences
- Refusal Explanation: Contextually appropriate but not literal match

#### **2. Completeness Evaluation Prompt:**
```
Current: "Evaluate if this answer provides meaningful information."
Issue: Expects exhaustive detail rather than sufficient information
```

**Evidence:** Both models rejected System Prompt refusal for being "incomplete"

#### **3. Binary Pass/Fail Threshold:**
```
Current: All three criteria (Relevance, Grounding, Completeness) must pass
Issue: Creates AND gate that's too restrictive
```

### **Recommended Prompt Improvements:**

#### **1. More Flexible Grounding:**
```
IMPROVED: "The answer PASSES if it doesn't contradict the fragments.
Minor paraphrasing and reasonable inferences are acceptable."
```

#### **2. Contextual Completeness:**
```
IMPROVED: "The answer PASSES if it provides sufficient information 
to address the question appropriately in the given context."
```

#### **3. Weighted Scoring:**
```
IMPROVED: Use weighted combination rather than strict AND logic:
- Critical failures (safety, major factual errors): Auto-fail
- Minor issues: Reduce score but don't auto-fail
```

- **Revise grounding prompts** to be less literal
- **Adjust completeness criteria** to be context-aware

### **2. Prompt Engineering:**
- Implement tiered evaluation (critical vs minor issues)
- Add examples of acceptable paraphrasing in grounding prompts
- Use confidence scoring rather than binary decisions

### **3. Future Testing:**
- Test revised prompts with both models
- Expand labeled dataset for more robust evaluation
- Consider ensemble approaches combining both models

### **4. Model Selection Strategy:**
- **Mistral Small:** Better for production (balanced, fast, accurate)
- **Mistral Large:** Consider for critical safety-only filtering
- **Hybrid Approach:** Small for general evaluation, Large for safety double-check

## üìã **Conclusion**

While **Mistral Large** is theoretically more capable, our current prompt design creates over-conservative behavior that hurts practical performance. **Mistral Small** provides the optimal balance of:

- ‚úÖ High accuracy (92%)
- ‚úÖ Appropriate strictness level
- ‚úÖ Fast evaluation speed
- ‚úÖ Cost effectiveness

The analysis reveals that **prompt engineering is critical** - even superior models can underperform with poorly calibrated prompts. This highlights the importance of:

1. **Empirical evaluation** over theoretical model capabilities
2. **Task-specific prompt optimization**
3. **Balanced precision-recall trade-offs**

**Next Steps:** Implement recommended prompt improvements and re-evaluate both models with the enhanced evaluation criteria.
