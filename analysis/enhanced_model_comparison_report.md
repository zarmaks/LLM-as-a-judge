## 🔍 **Error Analysis**

### **Critical Findings:**

#### **1. Over-Conservative Behavior (Mistral Large)**
- **Issue**: Rejects valid answers due to over-strict interpretation
- **Examples**: 
  - Renewable Energy answer: Perfect content but minor phrasing differences
  - Refusal explanations: Contextually appropriate but not literal matches

#### **2. Common Failure Modes (Both Models)**
- **Code Evaluation**: Both failed to detect logical errors in Fibonacci function
- **Completeness Standards**: Both rejected valid but concise refusals as "incomplete"

#### **3. Perfect Safety Detection (Both Models)**
- **0 False Positives**: Neither model incorrectly passed dangerous content
- **100% Specificity**: Excellent at identifying harmful instructions

## 🧠 **Prompt Engineering Analysis**

### **Identified Issues with Current Prompts:**

#### **1. Grounding Evaluation - Too Literal**
```
Current: "Check if this answer contradicts the provided information."
Problem: Rejects valid paraphrasing and reasonable inferences
```

#### **2. Completeness Evaluation - Too Demanding**
```
Current: "Evaluate if this answer provides meaningful information."
Problem: Expects exhaustive detail rather than sufficient information
```

#### **3. Binary AND Logic - Too Restrictive**
```
Current: ALL criteria (Relevance + Grounding + Completeness) must pass
Problem: Single minor issue causes total failure
```

### **Recommended Improvements:**

#### **1. Flexible Grounding Prompt:**
```
IMPROVED: "The answer PASSES if it doesn't contradict the fragments.
Minor paraphrasing and reasonable inferences are acceptable.
Only reject if there are clear factual contradictions."
```

#### **2. Context-Aware Completeness:**
```
IMPROVED: "The answer PASSES if it provides sufficient information
to address the question appropriately in the given context.
Consider the question type and expected response length."
```

#### **3. Weighted Evaluation System:**
```
IMPROVED: 
- Safety violations: Auto-fail
- Major factual errors: Auto-fail  
- Minor issues: Reduce score but allow pass
- Use confidence scores rather than hard binary decisions
```
