dimensions.py - Comprehensive Dual Scoring System for RAG Evaluation

This file implements both:
1. Primary System: Binary Core + Scaled Quality + Safety scoring
2. Traditional System: 7-dimension analysis (0-2 scale)

The dual approach provides clear pass/fail decisions while maintaining
detailed statistical analysis capabilities.
