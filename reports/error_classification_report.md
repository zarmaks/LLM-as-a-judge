| **Social Science** | 2 | 15.4% | Document confusion, correlation vs causation |
| **General** | 1 | 7.7% | Miscellaneous topics |
| **Astronomy** | 1 | 7.7% | Light scattering concepts |

## Detailed Error Examples

### 1. Factual Errors (30.8% of errors)
- **Japan Capital**: "Kyoto" instead of "Tokyo"
- **Australia Capital**: "Sydney" instead of "Canberra" 
- **Water Boiling Point**: "120°C" instead of "100°C"
- **Mars Moons**: "One moon" instead of "Two moons"

### 2. Conceptual Errors (23.1% of errors)
- **Ocean Tides**: Attributed to wind instead of gravitational forces
- **Ice Floating**: Claimed ice sinks due to being heavier
- **Sky Color**: Attributed to ocean reflection instead of Rayleigh scattering

### 3. Category Mismatches (23.1% of errors)
- **Digestive System**: Listed heart/lungs instead of digestive organs
- **Declaration vs Constitution**: Confused historical documents
- **Fibonacci Function**: Implementation doesn't match specification

## Critical Issues Identified

### High-Priority Problems (30.8% of errors are high severity)
1. **Basic Factual Accuracy**: Fundamental facts are being confused
2. **Mathematical Verification**: Calculations lack verification steps
3. **Question Understanding**: Some answers address wrong questions entirely

### Pattern Analysis
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Clear deficiencies in geography and basic science
- **Verification Failure**: System doesn't catch obvious factual errors
- **Context Confusion**: Struggles with distinguishing similar concepts

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Implement Fact Verification**: Add mandatory verification for geographical, scientific, and mathematical facts
2. **Enhanced Question Parsing**: Improve question understanding to prevent category mismatches
3. **Calculation Validation**: Add step-by-step mathematical verification

### Medium-Term Improvements
1. **Knowledge Base Enhancement**: Focus on geography, basic science, and mathematics
2. **Conceptual Understanding**: Improve training on cause-and-effect relationships
3. **Domain-Specific Validators**: Create specialized checkers for different knowledge domains

### Quality Assurance
1. **Error Monitoring**: Track error types to identify emerging patterns
2. **Severity Escalation**: Flag high-severity errors for human review
3. **Continuous Learning**: Update knowledge base based on error patterns

## Statistical Insights

### Error Classification Effectiveness
- **Classification Coverage**: 100% (13/13 errors successfully classified)
- **High Confidence Classifications**: 69.2% (9/13 errors with >0.8 confidence)
- **Multi-type Errors**: 30.8% had secondary error types identified

### Domain Vulnerability Index
1. Mathematics: Most vulnerable (23.1% of errors)
2. Geography: High vulnerability (15.4% of errors)
3. Biology/Physics: Moderate vulnerability (15.4% each)

## Conclusion

The error classification analysis reveals that the RAG system has significant challenges with factual accuracy and conceptual understanding. With a 52% error rate and 30.8% high-severity errors, immediate improvements are needed in fact verification and question comprehension.

The predominance of factual errors (30.8%) suggests that the knowledge retrieval or verification mechanisms need strengthening. The high rate of conceptual errors (23.1%) indicates that the system struggles with understanding underlying principles rather than just memorizing facts.

**Priority Action**: Implement automated fact-checking for basic factual claims and mathematical calculations to reduce the high-severity error rate.
